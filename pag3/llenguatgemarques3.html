                      "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
                      men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
                      so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound 
                      to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of 
                      will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are 
                      perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled
                      and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed
                      and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
                      of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The
                      wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures 
                      to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
