                      "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
                      pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account
                      of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the 
                      truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids 
                      pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
                      pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there
                      anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
                      occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take 
                      a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage 
                      from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying 
                      consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
